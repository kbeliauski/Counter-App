# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I used it to go over some React basics and get some practice. This app is purely React, no backend here. There is a different project I created, where I used React and React Native for frontend and Django for backend. It's called Muse: [React Native version](https://github.com/kbeliauski/music-app-react-native) and [React version](https://github.com/jayxrey/musicapp). Muse is just a personal project that used to work amazing at the time of creation, but now that Django doesn't support the [JWT authentication package I used](https://github.com/jpadilla/django-rest-framework-jwt/issues/484), there might be some problems with authentication.

To run, type:
```
npm start
```
